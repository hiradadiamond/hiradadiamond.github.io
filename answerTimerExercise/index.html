                setTimeout(booyah, 2000);
                setTimeout(booyah(), 2000);

            <p>
                setTimeout(booyah, 2000): This is the actual way of giving parameters. Here after 2000 milliseconds,
                booyah() method is called;
                <br />
                setTimeout(booyah(), 2000): This is not the right way of giving parameters. Here without waiting 2000
                milliseconds it directly jumps to booyah() and performs it.

                4. What is "Unobtrusive Javascript"? What is the practical application of Unobtrusive Javascript (and
                the
                reasons for using it)?

                Answers:
                This is a standard and the right way of writing javascript code. This says that javascript should not be
                colluded with html and css. They should be writing separately in their own files. This also kind of
                aligns with the principle of separation of concern.
                One of the reasons to write Unobtrusive javascript is because adding javascript should be a constructive
                addition of new features. It should not destroy the existing html content when we want to update
                javascript. The other reason is that not all browsers support the javascript you write, so if the
                javascript is separated out from other components of a web page, at least the web page will work but
                with lower functionality i.e. with only html and css. Also, separating out javascript completely will
                help fellow developers who inherit the code to update and/or add features in the future later

                Obtrusive Way:
                <input id="inputText" type="text" value="<a href='some_url' onclick='window.open('some_other_url');return false;''>Click Me</a>"/>
            </pre>

                Unobtrusive Way:
                HTML File: index.html
                <input id="inputText" type="text" value=" <a href='some url' id='click_me_btn'>Click me</a>"/>
            </pre>
            <pre>
                Javascript File: script.js 
                var clickme = document.getElementById("click_me_btn");
                clickme.onclick = function() { };
